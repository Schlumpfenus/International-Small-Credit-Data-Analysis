# International-Small-Credit-Data-Analysis
This project was part of my data analyst education, in order to get the Data Analyst Certificate

The Analysis was coded in Python

**Table of contents:**

- Data set for analysis as a .csv, modified by module teacher - the original data set had more fields, teacher wanted to simplify it.
- Original .py file I worked with
- .html file which was turned in for review

I got 100/100 points for this project.
