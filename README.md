# International-Small-Credit-Data-Analysis
This project was part of my data analyst education, in order to get the Data Analyst Certificate

The Analysis was coded in Python, following the CRISP-DM data analysis approach.

**Table of contents:**

- Data set for analysis as a .csv, modified by module teacher - the original data set had more fields, teacher wanted to simplify it. (.zip file data_abschlussprojekt - unzipped file has about 100MB)
- Original .py file I worked with (202410081505_Abschlussprojekt_Schlumpfenus)
- .html file which was turned in for review (HD_AP_Final.html)

I got 100/100 points for this project.
